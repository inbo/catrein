# CATREIN projects

## LIFE+ project OZON 

[Project Sonian forest](http://www.sonianforest.be/lifeozon/project/natura-2000-life/life-in-the-sonian-forest/)

Busy traffic arteries cut through the Sonian Forest and fragment the forest into isolated patches:
the Brussels Ring Road, the E411, the railway between Brussels and Luxembourg, the Terhulpsesteenweg, the Duboislaan, the Tervuursesteenwegâ€¦ They all prevent the forest inhabitants from travelling between the different areas. About fifty animals are killed each year by the busy traffic in the forest. This was revealed by monitoring that took place in the context of the _Dood doet Leven_ project.

The LIFE+ project OZON (= Defragmentation of Sonian Forest) aims to reconnect these ecological hotspots. To that end, more than ten wildlife crossings will be constructed during the next four years. The most spectacular is no doubt the wildlife bridge between Groenendaal and Waterloo, which should be finished in 2017.

On several places the use of wildlife crossings, wildlife tunnels, wildlife pipes and tree bridges is monitored using camera traps. From the start some of the project partners used Agouti as a platform to store their images. Within the framework of Catrein, a short workshop was organized recently discussing camera settings and the use of Agouti. All project partners now will use Agouti to store and annotate their images - allowing also a standardised data analysis by Catrein project partners such as INBO.
