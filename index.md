Welcome on the CATREIN page

The Catrein project wants to facilitate and enhance wildlife research using camera traps in Belgium.

For this purpose investments are done both in hardware (> 60 Reconyx Hyperfire HC 600 cameras) and in software. The chosen software
(www.agouti.eu) allows users to manage surveys, annotate images, archive images and data and produce standard reports using metadata
standards. 

We want to create a community of researchers using camera traps in Belgium and facilitate their research by sharing knowledge on practical
aspects such as camera types and field protocols as well as by providing and sharing scripts in R allowing standardized data analysis and
reporting. By performing standardized analysis in R for camera trap users unfamiliar with this kind of data analysis we hope to encourage
them to use the agouti platform and bridge the gap between camera trap use and wildlife research. 

Enabling citizen science projects to store images of camera traps and allowe citizens to identify species, sex and age is one of the
next steps for Catrein.

Publishing the collected data as open data fill finally allow the share the results of camera trap research in Belgium with other
researchers abroad.
